This should be done before importing the package


Tested by creating an empty 3D unity project
Then installing open XR
Project settings> XR Plugin Management> Install
Once installed Tick Open XR
Wait for it to install packages
Click yes
Project may  restart

Project settings> OpenXR
Interaction profiles> click the + in the bottom right of the box
Tested with Oculus touch controller profile
